This README will serve more as a note to myself on sections and lessons rather than being a TL;DR description for anyone looking through here. In saying that I do hope hope it's descriptive enough for Recruiters and Devs otherwise I'll assume I'm not explaining it well enough for future me to understand.

My commits will likely serve as a good refresher for all that I have done because I am over-commiting with the intent of them acting as notes. I do want to keep good commit practices so anything noteworthy that is too long will be written in here.


With the power of npm, webpack and postcss I am learning how to use the IMPORT postcss plugin to split my css code into partial files for better understanding and organisation from which I will import into the main styles.css style sheet. (commit dates for this lesson start 01/June/2023)

Reintroduced myself to CSS Selectors and specifcally used the class selector on a div block to move text over an image.
