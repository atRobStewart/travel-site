This README will serve more as a note to myself on sections and lessons rather than being a TL;DR description for anyone looking through here. In saying that I do hope hope it's descriptive enough for Recruiters and Devs otherwise I'll assume I'm not explaining it well enough for future me to understand.


With the power of npm, webpack and postcss I am learning how to use the IMPORT postcss plugin to split my css code into partial files for better understanding and organisation from which I will import into the main styles.css style sheet. (commit dates for this lesson start 01/June/2023)

Reintroduced myself to CSS Selectors and specifcally used the class selector on a div block to move text over an image.
